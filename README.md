# Lab 2

Parallel and distributed computing plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency and performance of computational tasks. This lab introduces fundamental concepts by exploring parallelism using threads and processes in Python.  

The lab consists of three main implementations:  

1. **Sequential Execution** – Functions are executed one after another, generating and processing random data.  
2. **Threading** – The same functions are executed concurrently using Python threads to analyze the impact of parallel execution.  
3. **Multiprocessing** – The functions are executed in separate processes, leveraging multiple CPU cores for potential performance gains.  

To evaluate performance, execution time is recorded for each case, and key performance metrics such as **speedup**, **efficiency**, and theoretical models (**Amdahl’s Law & Gustafson’s Law**) are applied. The analysis provides insights into the benefits and limitations of different parallel computing approaches.
